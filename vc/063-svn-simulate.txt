6.3 Simulate two developers

    Check out the project (that was imported in previous step) to
    a another, separate, location:

        $HOME/tmp/svn/projects/test2

    You should how have the same project in *two* locations:

    $HOME/tmp/svn/projects/
    |
    +-- test/
    |
    +-- test2/

    Work in both directories:

    - Make changes & commit
    - Switch to other directory;
+ remember to download updates from central repository!
+ Make changes and commit
    ... repeat several times ...

    Create test2:
    cd $HOME/tmp/svn/projects/
    mkdir test2
    cd test2
    svn co file:///$HOME/repository/svn-exercise/repo.svn/ test2.svn
    cd test2/trunk

    Work in both directories:
    <make changes>
    svn ci -m <message>
    cd ~/tmp/svn/projects/test/test.svn/trunk OR ~/tmp/svn/projects/test2/test2.svn/trunk
    svn up
    <repeat several times>
