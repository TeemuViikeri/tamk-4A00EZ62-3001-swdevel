1.3 Unpatch

    After completing the previous exercise, you have files:

        One.java.orig
        One.java
        One.java.patch

    Downgrade, i.e. "unpatch" the changes by using One.java.patch and
    appropriate patch(1) command line options. The result should be
    as follows:

        One.java.orig         Original
        One.java              Identical to Original ("downgraded")
        One.java.patch        Difference i.e. "The Patch"
