5.3 Hg and commits

    Use a *.java file to do real development to modify and to
    create new methods.

    Make at least 10 commits of following types:

    - Single commit changes. Change one file over and over.

    - Change sets. Make a LOGICAL change that requires changing
      multiple files at once. Like renaming a method from A to B
      in several files. Commit this as ONE logical commit.

    cd /src
    repeat 10 times: <make change(s) to *.java file(s)> & hg commit -m <message>
