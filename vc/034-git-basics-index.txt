3.4 Git index

    What is it? How does it work? Do following:

    Git index is a stating area where you can add changed filex to be prepared
    to commit into their correspongind repository. You can also remove files from index
    if you change your mind about adding file to the index. 

    A. Add file with "git add". Oooops. That was a mistake.
        Unadd the file (i.e take action out of INDEX).

    git restore --staged <file>

    B. remove a file with "git rm".  That was a mistake.
        Unremove the file (i.e take action out of INDEX).

    git rm --cached <file>
