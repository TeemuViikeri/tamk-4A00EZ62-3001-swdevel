4.2 Git diff and cherry picking

    Branches are used to isolate work.

    A. Make a branch. Make two commits. Take a diff
        between master and your current work in branch.

    git diff master..temp-branch

    B. Make a documentation change in a branch.
        Cherry pick this individual commit to "master".

        Learn and understand what "cherry picking" means in regards
        to merging a branch.

    <create /doc folder> 
    <create doc.txt file>
    git add -A
    git commit -m <message>
    git checkout/switch master
    git cherry-pick <commit>

    Cherry picking is like rebase but with single commits. You take commits from an other branch and 
    create a new commit to the current branch. It's better to use cherry picking when there are lots of commits
    in a branch but you just want to integrate couple of them and not the whole branch with its commits.
