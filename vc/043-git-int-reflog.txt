4.3 Git reflog

    A. What is a reflog? How do you list it?

    Git keeps track of changes made to the tip of branches using reference logs aka "reflogs".
    Using this reflog in Git, you can list these reference logs in your terminal and use them.

    git reflog

    B. Add file. Commit it. Add another file. commit it.
        Ooops those were mistakes. use reflog to find your COMMIT
        that was before TWO ADDS and reset your repository to this
        point.

    <add file>
    git add <file>
    git commit -m <message>
    <add file>
    git add <file>
    git commit -m <message>
    git reflog
    <take commit before additions>
    git reset --hard <commit>

    C. Hmm, on the other hand -- you want to keep those two new
        ADDED FILE. Use reflog to locate the last commit and
        reset your repository to COMMIT that includes the TWO
        files.

    Reflog is a powerful thing. Don't get too exited or you get
    tangled up!

    git reflog
    <take commit after two added files>
    git reset --hard <commit>
