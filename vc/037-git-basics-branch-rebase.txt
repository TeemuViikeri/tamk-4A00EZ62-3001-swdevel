3.7 Git branches and rebase

    What does "rebasing a branch" mean? Demonstrate this in
    your repository.

        [BEFORE REBASE]

        master: o -- o -- o -- *
                      \
        devel:         o -- o -- o

        [AFTER REBASE]

        master: o -- o -- o -- *
                                \
        devel:                   o -- o -- o

    
    Rebasing a branch means that you move commits from an existing branch
    to a new base in another branch. This makes it seem like the original branch
    doesn't exist and the branch starts from the desired base (commit, i.e. in "master").
    But in reality, the original branch does still exist but Git reapplies the original commits in the original branch
    and moves those commits to the wanted branch.

    <starts in "master", both branches are same>
    git checkout devel
    <make a change>
    git add <file>
    git commit -m "Make a change to <file>."
    <make a change>
    git add <file>
    git commit -m "Make a change to <file>."
    git checkout master
    <make a change>
    git add <file>
    git commit -m "Make a change to <file>."
    <make a change>
    git add <file>
    git commit -m "Make a change to <file>."
    git checkout devel
    git rebase master
