4.1 Make release

    When the code is tested and ready to be published, it is
    marked with a release tag. See lecture
    http://home.tamk.fi/~jaalto/course/vc/lect/git/#tagging_files

    A. tag your repository as "release/1.0.0"

    <in master>
    git tag (use option -a to annotate a tag) release/1.0.0 (use option -m to specify tagging message when annotating a tag)

    B. How do you list existing tags?

    git tag (with optional -l or --list, mandatory when using a wildcard pattern)

    C. How do you know the particular tag's commit HASH?

    git show <tag>

    D. Take a diff between last release TAG and 2 commits backward.

    git diff <last release tag> (i.e. "release/1.0.0") HEAD~2
