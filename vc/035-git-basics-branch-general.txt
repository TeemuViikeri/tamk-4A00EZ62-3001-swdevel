3.5 Git branches in general

    Learn to understand what is "master", what is "devel" and what
    are the "feature branches". This is the core of Git
    development. See lectures and:
    http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

    

    A. What command shows the branch you're currently on?

    git branch --show-current

    B. Clone "master" to "devel". Why don't you want to
        work in master?

    git branch devel

    You don't want to work in "master" because it reserved for a build that is in a production-ready state.
    Worked source code is located in "devel" which is then merged to "master" when "devel" is in a state
    which is production-ready. Feature branches are created from devel and merged back to devel when the single
    feature is ready.
