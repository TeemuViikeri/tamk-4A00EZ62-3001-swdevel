Svn is centralized version control system. It is based on
client-server architecture and needsa separate SERVER for live
operation over Internet,

Make sure you understand the default repository setup at the SERVER:

project/
|
+- branches/  || contains branch copies
|
+- trunk/     || main line of development
|
+- tags/      || contains tag copies

Recall lectures what is the purpose of each directory. This
is key to understanding Svn.

For the exercises:

- SERVER location is $HOME/repository/svn-exercise
- CLIENT location is $HOME/tmp/svn/projects

6.1 Initialize

    On the SERVER, initialize repository. On the CLIENT import an
    empty project directory named "test" into the SERVER space.
    Your SERVER will now have a repository:

    svn-exercise
    |
    +-- test/
        |
        +- branches/
        |
        +- trunk/
        |
        +- tags/

    mkdir -p ~/repository/svn-exercise
    mkdir -p ~/tmp/svn/projects
    cd ~/repository/svn-exercise
    svnadmin create --fs-type fsfs SERVER
    cd ~/tmp/svn/projects
    mkdir test
    cd test
    svn import -m "Initial import" . file:///$HOME/repository/svn-exercise/SERVER/
