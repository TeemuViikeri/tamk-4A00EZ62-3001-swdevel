5.5 Hg and clone

    Make a clone of existing repository.

    cd project.hg
    hg clone . project-temp.hg 

    A. Make changes in clone.

    cd project-temp.hg
    <make changes>
    hg ci -m <message>
    cd .. (to project-temp.hg)

    B. Merge changes back to master repository.
    
    cd ../project.hg
    hg incoming -p ../project-temp.hg/  || check what you are pulling
    hg pull ../project-temp.hg/         || pull changes
    hg update                           || pull doesn't do the merging yet, only fetching, update will the merge.

    Make sure you understand that a clone command is the correct
    way in Hg to make a "branch". You don't _EVER_ want to use the
    hg's internal "branch" command! Recall Hg workflow and branch
    documentation from Hg's manual to really *understand* why this
    is so.
