    NOTE: Always use option --unified or -u with diff(1).
    This makes it posssible to use --fuzz option with patch(1). See

    $HOME/tmp/

     +-- project1/
     |   |
     |   +-- src/
     |       One.java
     |
     +-- project2/
         |
         +-- src/
             Two.java

    - Copy current file One.java under name One.java.orig

    cp One.java One.java.orig 

    - Change One.java. The file is now *ahead* of saved *.orig
      file.

    vim One.java --> change

    - Take a diff between One.java.orig and One.java and save it
      to file:

            One.java.patch

    diff -u *.orig One.java > One.java.patch

    You have three files:

        One.java.orig         Original
        One.java              Modified
        One.java.patch        Difference i.e. "The Patch"
