2.5 Managing locks and file permissions

    RCS uses locks to prevent others from editing the files.
    Complete following exercise in project1

    - Check out One.java

    co -l One.java

    - Modify file One.java

    vim One.java --> edit

    ... and you decide to throw away changes and start over

    The problem you are facing is that the file has already been
    checked out and locked to you.

    The steps to start over are:

    (1) breaking out the lock i.e. removing the lock

    rcs -u One.java

    RCS file: RCS/One.java,v
    1.5 unlocked
    done

    (2) removing the modified file from current work directory

    rm One.java

    (3) checking out the original file for editing (start from fresh)

    co -l One.java

    (4) Making a change (correct this time)

    vim One.java --> edit

    (5) committing new revision to the version control tree.

    ci One.java
