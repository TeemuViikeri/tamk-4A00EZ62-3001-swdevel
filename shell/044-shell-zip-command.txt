4.4 Archiving

    Explain command line syntax to zip(1) everything in a
    archive "test.zip" from directory structure listed in 4.2.

    NOTE: the directory structure *must* not contain any
    *absolute paths. Only relative paths, like:

        dir1/1.lst
        dir1/2.txt
        dir1/dir2/1.txt
        ...

    List zip content with: unzip -v *.zip

    cd tmp
    cd test2
    zip -r test .
