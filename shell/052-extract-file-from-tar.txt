5.2 Extracting one file from TAR archive

    From previous exercise "archive.tar.gz", extract file:

            project/README

        What is is the combination of commands to extract just one
        file from a TAR archive?

        NOTE: you are not allowed to extract *all* the files on
        disk, then picking one, and delete the rest of the files.

    tar -xf archive.tar.gz project/README
