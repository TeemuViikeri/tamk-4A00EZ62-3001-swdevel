    Explain (mentioning key bindings), to do the following:

        Write programming code (*.java). Use same variable
        multiple times. Replace the variable name everywhere.

            System.out.println("Company" + companyName);

    1. emacs <file>: open file with emacs
    2. write programming code and use same variable multiple times
    3. put cursor point to start of the file (if you want to replace all matches that occur in the file)
    4. M-x replace-string <RET> string <RET> newstring: replace all matched string occurances that exists in the file (from cursor point onwards) with newstring
    5. C-x C-s: save file
    6. C-x C-c: exit emacs
