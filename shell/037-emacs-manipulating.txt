3.7 Manipulating buffers and windows

    Explain key bindings:

        C-x b   = change to buffer (C-x follows buffer name and then RET)
        C-x C-b = show buffer list

        C-x 2   = split window in half (copies the current window to split window second buffer)
        C-x o   = change to other window (the "o" like in: (o)ther)
        C-x 1   = one window (current buffer)
